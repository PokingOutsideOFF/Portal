            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">Career guidance consists of services that help people successfully manage their career development. Although this aspect of human
                development occurs on its own as we mature, everyone  can  benefit  from  assistance  navigating through this process. Career guidance is a set of intervention strategies designed to ease the  career development of the individual. Career guidance is  a broad  term, which  includes the development of job search, on interview skills, placement into a chosen vocation, and follows up
                the  placement  to  ensure  effectiveness.  In  career guidance, counseling is used as one of the interventional strategies.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">    Choosing the right career is a very crucial event in the life of any aspirant. One wrong choice can spoil their entire future. So it 
                is necessary to analyze one's strengths and weakness and consult experienced individuals before making a choice. There are no 
                specific signs which may show in which domain does an individual have aptitude in but the interest of an individual will surely 
                help in gauging it. However, there are plenty of negative influences which can mar the future of an individual ,so it is necessary 
                to avoid these. Some of them are listed below:

               <li>
                   Following the crowd/friends:
                   This is one of the most common mistakes which most of the students unknowingly make. Many students just take up 
                   any stream because their friends have decided to take that stream. This can turn out to be the worst decision of 
                   their lives. It is necessary that you chose the stream which you are most passionate about rather than doing what 
                   most of the students are doing.

                   Parental/Societal pressure:
                   Generally when a child informs his parents that he is interested to take up an unconventional stream the first 
                   response is to raise objections .Most of the time this response is due to the decisions which they had made when 
                   they were faced with a similar situation . Many students would have faced a similar situation. This can lead to a 
                   flawed career decision.It might look like that a particular stream is the path for a bright future . But if you 
                   get proper career guidance from an expert (career counsellor), choosing a career path after 10th will be much 
                   easier.

                   Lack of knowledge:
                   There are a plethora of career options after 10th. If we go back 10-20 years ago, there were very fewer career 
                   options to choose from. But now the scenario is completely different. There are many career options available 
                   and with the help of proper career guidance and career counselling the student will be equipped with the 
                   knowledge to make the right career decision.

                The purpose of the portal is to provide guidance to students with respect to their career choices. The current 
                system has numerous limitations some of which include unavailability of counsellors, limited time frames, lack of 
                technical management and many more. The portal aims to resolve these issues. The information available on the 
                portal is free of cost, well curated and is easily accessible.
