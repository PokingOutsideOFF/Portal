            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">Career guidance consists of services that help people successfully manage their career development. Although this aspect of human
                development occurs on its own as we mature, everyone  can  benefit  from  assistance  navigating through this process. Career guidance is a set of intervention strategies designed to ease the  career development of the individual. Career guidance is  a broad  term, which  includes the development of job search, on interview skills, placement into a chosen vocation, and follows up
                the  placement  to  ensure  effectiveness.  In  career guidance, counseling is used as one of the interventional strategies.</p>
            <p style="padding-left: 15px;">    The purpose of the portal is to provide guidance to students with respect to their career choices. The current system has numerous limitations some of which include unavailability of counsellors, limited time frames, lack of technical
                management and many more. The portal aims to resolve these issues. The information available on the portal is free of cost, well curated and is easily accessible.  </p>
