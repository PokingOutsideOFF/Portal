                    A course in Pharmacy deals with teaching students how to dispense and prepare medicines. The course also makes the 
                    student aware of drug-related information. The students of this course will be able to give advice on health care 
                    programmes as they will be more aware of the prescriptions given by doctors. They will also be able to evaluate drugs 
                    and drug use patterns. To become a pharmacist, you will have to pursue a 4-year B.Pharma programme. Many colleges/
                    institutes conduct entrance exams for entry into this course.

                    The demand for career options after 12th as an Architecture is on the rise. Architects are licensed

                    in every phase of a building's development from conception to construction. To become an architect, one can 
                    pursue a Bachelor of Architecture (B.Arch.) program, which typically takes five years to complete after class 
                    12th. Aspiring architects who have already earned a bachelor's degree in another field, like architectural 
                    history or construction management, can apply to a Master of Architecture (M.Arch.) program. These advanced 
                    programs are also open to applicants who have professional B.Arch. degrees and want to specialize in historic 
                    preservation, design theory, solar design, or another related field.
